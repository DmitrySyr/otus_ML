2781,2018-05-29T21:24:00-CME-001,,5.0,91.0,11.0,190.0,S,"Source is an eruption with rising material at 14:00Z off the west limb of SDO AIA 171 imagery. It is faintly visible in the SOHO LASCO C2/C3 images and barely visible, if not visible at all, in STA cor2."
2782,2018-05-30T03:24:00-CME-001,,0.0,-110.0,17.0,263.0,S,Source is an eruption beyond the east limb characterized by opening field lines best seen in SDO AIA 171 around 2:40Z. This eruption can also be seen near disk center of STA EUVI 195 with some dimming and post eruptive arcades after a data gap from 2018-05-29T21:05Z to 2018-05-30T03:05Z.

CME can be seen pushing part of an existing streamer along with it (see C2 frames)."

2786,2018-06-17T09:00:00-CME-001,,9.0,109.0,21.0,309.0,S,The source was off-limb opening field lines in the south west most apparent at 2018-06-17T19:30Z in SDO AIA 171.
2787,2018-06-19T23:12:00-CME-001,,15.0,-76.0,21.0,344.0,S,"The CME is a streamer blowout, so there was no clear lower coronal signature in the solar disk. The likely signatures are the movement of the streamer yesterday and a brightening of the coronal hole in the northeast of the solar disk visible in 193 A at about 2018-06-19T22:00Z."

2792,2018-07-10T08:54:00-CME-001,,-10.0,-96.0,10.0,293.0,S,Start time is unclear as the CME has no clear leading edge.
2793,2018-07-17T21:36:00-CME-001,,-3.0,146.0,14.0,205.0,S,Source region is probably on the back side.
